# GenderHeight_SportTeams
Web scraping tool to see if varsity swimmers are on average taller than their volleyball counterparts

Our goal is to utilize the Baruch men’s and women’s swimming and volleyball teams’ roster pages to web scrape for their height and find the average heights in centimeters.

My results were in line with my hypothesis. In general, the average volleyball player is taller than the swimming team. This makes sense and is in line with my hypothesis, you need more speed in swimming rather than height since it’s a race. In volleyball, taller players are needed to spike, attack, and block the ball successful over the net. The nets are high, so it will be more advantageous to be taller when you are in the front. Of course, we still have to keep in mind that these results may differ when scraping more data from different varsity teams.
